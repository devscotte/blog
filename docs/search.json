    "text": "The foundation for the Bayesian section of the blog\n\nTL;DR\n\n\nCode\n#Import libraries\nimport pandas as pd\nimport numpy as np\nimport matplotlib.pyplot as plt\nimport seaborn as sns\n\n\nStatistics has long been a subject of great debate because of the way it is implmented. Due to “arbitrary” rules or guidelines that the academic community or business organizations follow in this field, it can be easy to be confused as to why certain numbers matter, if results from experiments actually have genuine impact, and how can we improve of the results we obtained. As well, what do we do when a test results contradicts what a subject matter expert says they expected to happen? Bayesian methods attempt to clear the confusion surrounding statistics. Bayesian methods allow us to incorporate our own knowledge into statistical modeling practices to properly draw conclusions from data. From those conclusions, we can gain direction and insight on what kind of decisions to make to better guide an organization.\n\n\nIntroduction: A New Place\n\n\n\nSuppose you just moved to a new town. In this town, you would like to take advantage of the public bus system to get to work. You look up online information about the nearest station to you and see that the first bus arrives at 7:00am and there should be subsequent buses every 15 minutes. The first day, you decide to get to the bus station a couple minutes before 7:30 to be sure you make the bus. The bus arrives at 7:32am. The next day, you decided to arrive a couple minutes early again. This time, the bus doesn’t arrive until 7:40am. The third day, you decide to show up right at 7:30am and the bus arrives at the same time as you. With all this variation in arrival time from the bus, can you trust the prediction that the bus arrives every 15 minutes?\nIn order to solve this problem, you phone a friend who we’ll call Fred. Fred is a statistician so you trust that his insights will help you with determine when would be a good time to arrive at the bus stop given all this variation in data. He tells you that first he’ll need a decent sample size to work with, so that you’ll need to go at least 20 more times to get good data points on the bus arrival time. Then, he would set up what he calls a “hypothesis test” to determine whether or not the true average arrival time of the bus is every 15 minutes. You ask if the hypothesis test will tell him what the true average arrival time would be and Fred says no. It would only tell whether or not it is 15 minutes or not. But, he explains we could use a confidence interval to find a range where 95% of the time the true average would be found.\nYou walk away from this conversation a little disappointed. You just don’t have time to sit out and record waiting times for that many buses. You want better judgement on when to arrive at the bus station, but not that much. As you wait for the bus again, you meet a girl named Bailey. You two start chatting and you start talking about how you can best estimate when to arrive at the bus station so you don’t have to wait very long but also won’t miss your bus. She asks if this is your first time riding a bus to work and you explain that in your old town you used to ride their bus system as well. She asks if the old town is similar in size as this new town and you say yes. She then explains that you can just use your “prior” knowledge of how frequently buses arrived and how long you waited to help you in your approximation of bus arrival time, with the new knowledge of the current bus system. Essentially, she explains that you can systematically update your beliefs each day based on new data you experience (when the bus arrives/how long you wait). Thanks to this way of thinking, you can always know a plausible range of values for how long you’ll be waiting and not just an average.\nYou explain to her your data points so far (2 mins, 12 mins, 0 mins) and say that at most, in your old town, arriving a couple of minutes before expected arrival time of the bus yielded on averag a wait time of about 6 mins. She explains to you that this will be your benchmark prior, that you expect to wait on average about 6 mins with some amount of variance in wait time. Now, even with just 3 data points, we can update this belief of 6 mins to align it what is actually the average and distribution of wait time for the bus. With waiting 2 mins, we would believe the average to be a little lower than 6 mins. After the 12 mins wait, we could say that we believe the average to be closer to 6-7 mins. With 0 mins, we can update our belief to be less than 6 mins.\nThis all sounds very intuitive and easy for you… so you ask if this is even a viable scientific method of measuring averages, variance, and in general quantifying your uncertainty? She says that it is! All thanks to Bayesian inference.\n\n\nBayesian Inference: The Math Behind Updating Beliefs\nThe example above is a major simplification of the actual mathematical implementation of Bayesian inference. However, it does capture the idea that there is a way to update our belief in something by drawing on past data (prior belief) and updating that belief with new data that we observe, thus obtaining a a new distribution of uncertainty we use in judgements/calculations. The formula for this kind of thinking is shown below.\n\n\\(P(H|\\theta) = \\frac{P(H) P(\\theta|H)} {P(\\theta)}\\)\n\nWe’ll break down the formula as follows.\n\n\nCode\nnp.random.seed(42)\nnp.random.poisson(lam=3, size=30)\n\n\nNameError: name 'np' is not defined\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbus_times = np.random.exponential(15, 30)\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.hist(bus_times)\nplt.axvline(x=bus_times.mean(), color='black', linestyle='dashed')\nplt.hist(bus_times, cumulative=True, linestyle='dashed', density = True, histtype='step');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nplt.hist(bus_times, cumulative=True, linestyle='dashed', density = True, histtype='step');\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCode\nnp.random.normal(loc=15, scale=5, size=30)\n\n\narray([24.70768916, 13.69915225,  7.70262465, 12.50984248, 19.91917384,\n       14.19003404, 14.79596696, 13.94864534, 12.33791079, 16.2093166 ,\n       18.2745666 , 16.28247189, 12.98810549, 13.04995567, 26.59331935,\n       13.77914001,  9.87080984, 11.53593212, 22.25553859, 13.43176546,\n       16.90729668, 15.40166026, 12.28329708, 13.51451858, 19.02199068,\n       25.06411778, 15.83245462, 23.38034683, 17.81872343, 11.74931218])\n\n\n\n\nCode\nbus_times\n\n\narray([ 9.94780641,  9.49718272, 21.94353187, 14.43235363,  5.53168298,\n        4.56829551, 18.37460275, 19.98077731, 30.07312976,  1.96304858,\n        1.8255759 ,  3.17128401,  0.95175978,  4.88946946,  1.2898627 ,\n       19.80629142,  5.82282514, 16.48227623, 21.57035029,  7.33622781,\n        0.56891505,  0.05800917, 39.49920522, 32.23018656, 51.58192211,\n       18.90982217,  0.71897336, 27.39496168, 46.37839066, 47.90536189])"

    "text": "TL;DR\nWelcome to Bayesian Business! This blog focuses on the use of statistics, particularly bayesian statistics, in the application of business problems. In this post, we review the necessary math background in order to understand future blog posts. As well, we establish expectations for future blog posts and the order in which they are shared.\n\n\nWelcome To Bayesian Business\nWelcome to my blog! If you are reading this, I hope that means you are excited about learning statistics as I am about teaching it (and continuing to learn it!). This blog, honestly, is mostly a tool for me to improve my own knowledge in statistics by learning how I would convey it to others. I plan on doing this from a data analysis perspective. Given a certain situation/set of data points, how do we construct the problems we want to solve and implement proper solutions. Particularly, I hope to demonstrate that Bayesian methods can be viable methods to solve problems in business, healthcare, etc. Anyways, I hope you find this blog interesting and useful in your data career. Whether you are just entering data or are an experienced data professional, this blog intends to be a resource in demonstrating good data analysis with sound applied mathematical theory.\n\n\nPrerequisites\nWhile I did mention above that this blog is intended to be useful for beginners and experts alike, I will admit that I will be covering some higher level math, such as: - Multivariate Calculus - Linear Algebra - Probability Theory\nFor example, suppose we are studying a dataset with a variable that is modeled as an exponential random variable, we would use the below notation to show the probability density function (PDF)\n\\[\\begin{equation}\n\\int_{0}^{\\infty} \\lambda e^{\\lambda x} \\,dx\n\\end{equation}\\]\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nX \\sim Exponential(\\lambda)\n\\end{equation}\\]\nOr, the important Bayes Theorem found below.\n\\[\\begin{equation}\nP(A|B) = \\frac{P(B|A) P(A)}{P(B)}\n\\end{equation}\\]\nDon’t be discourage if the above formulas don’t make sense right now. In each post that these appear, I will breakdown what they mean and their applicability in solving our problem.\n\n\nExpectations\nThe hope of this blog is to present statistics in the form of a data analysis case. For example, let’s say you are a host on AirBnB and want to maximize the number of nights you rent out. How do you properly price your rental given certain parameters (size, geographic setting, etc). We would then present the data points and walk through an analysis of the data by doing the following.\n\nExploring the data (EDA) to get to know our dataset\nConstructing a mathematical framework that can fit our data\nFit our data to said framework\nGather inference from our model\nReview answers explained by our model\nExplain possible enhancements to our model for future analyses\n\nThis will be our attempted framework to blog posts. I hope that by tackling problems in this way, analytical toolbox will grow and our ability to construct measurable problems from our data will improve. This is the ultimate goal of this blog. I really hope that people will recognize this blog as an opportunity to learn how to think analytically.\n\n\nLet’s do this\nI just want to reiterate that I am excited to learn how to be a better analyst with you by getting to know the math that drives our analytics. I am very passionate about how data can be used to properly drive decision making in organizations and I hope that this blog motivates you to do the same."
